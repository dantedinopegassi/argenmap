| This function has its perks. First, this piece could be structured              |
| into three parts. Import and declare values/arguments, then initialize          |
| framework (map), and then do whatever has to be done.                           |
|                                                                                 |
| Second, France :)                                                               |
| JK, config.InitialMap stores an initial level of latitude,                      |
| longitude and zoom, which is parsed with the spread operator,                   |
| Ã  la React.                                                                     |
|                                                                                 |
| Third, a layer property is declared. And since it should exist, it              |
| starts with a "null" value. "undefined" is discouraged. For                     |
| reference: https://dmitripavlutin.com/7-tips-to-handle-undefined-in-javascript/ |
|                                                                                 |
| Fourth, the JSON file could be empty or missing, and so there's                 |
| "?." to check nested properties. This is called _optional chaining_.            |
